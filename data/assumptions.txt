Data Assumptions for Synthetic Vahan Dashboard Dataset

1. Data Source: The data is synthetically generated to replicate the structure and content of the public Vahan Dashboard, as no direct download link was available.

2. Time Frame: The dataset covers a period of three years, from January 1, 2022, to the current date, to allow for the calculation of Year-over-Year (YoY) and Quarter-over-Quarter (QoQ) growth metrics.

3. Granularity: The data is provided at a monthly level, with each entry representing the total registrations for a specific manufacturer, vehicle type, and month.

4. Vehicle Types: The dataset includes three vehicle categories as specified in the assignment: 2W (Two-wheelers), 3W (Three-wheelers), and 4W (Four-wheelers).

5. Manufacturers: The manufacturers are fictional but representative of the real market leaders in each vehicle category. The same manufacturer may appear in multiple categories (e.g., Bajaj in both 2W and 3W).

6. Registration Numbers: The registration numbers are random integers within a specific range for each vehicle type, scaled to provide a semblance of realism (e.g., 2W registrations are higher than 3W registrations). No specific market trends or seasonal variations are embedded in the data.

7. Missing Data: The synthetic dataset does not contain any missing or null values. Real-world data would require additional cleaning and handling of missing values.
